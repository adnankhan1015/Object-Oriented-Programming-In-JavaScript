// In js we have only OBJECTS.
// ? SO how can we implement inheritance only using objects?

// Here we have Shape object and another object we have is circle
// and add all the common behavior or all the common methods in this object(Shape) like computeMinLocation() and then somehow we can link a circle object to the shape object.

// Now we refer to the shape object as the prototype of the circle object

// So "Prototype" is essentially a parent of another object

// Whenever you hear the word prototype just think "PROTOTYPE"
// ! So every object in JavaScript except only a single object that I am going to show you has a prototype or parent and it inherit all the members we find in its prototype.

// Object.getPrototypeOf()

// ! Prototypical Inheritance
// When we accessing a property or a method on an object JavaScript Engine walks up the prototype chain to find the target member.

// ! Multi-Level Inheritance
// When we call an array, a layer added as a array prototype. and that is further derived from Object Prototype or (ObjectBase)

// ? What about the objects we create using custom constructor?

function Circle(radius) {
  this.radius = radius;

  this.draw = function () {
    console.log("Draw");
  };
}

const circle = new Circle(10);
// {}

// We created the circle object using this constructor.
//  inspect the circle object in the console,
// > circle
// It has a prototype
// Look this prototype is the prototype for all the circle object that we create using our circle constructor(Lets call it circleBase)

// So every time we call the circle constructor to create a new object.
// e.g new Circle(10)
// This constructor will create a new object and set its prototype property to circleBase
// ! In other words, Object Created by a given constructor will have the same prototype.

// So all circle objects created by the circle constructor will have the same prototype and similarly
// All arrays created by the array constructor will have the same prototype
